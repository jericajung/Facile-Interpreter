Question 1:
A review of Class Structures and Inheritance. In a separate pdf file

Question 3:
A templated merge sort function in which could sort any data type such
as strings or ints. It could be ordered from ascending or descending order.

To compile and run:
*Need to have a mergetest file..
make (the merge test file)
./(the mergest test file)

Question 4:
Qt in which the user can interact with the graphical debugger. The user
starts off with a load window in which he/she is asked to input in a input
file. When inputted correctly, the user is going to see a facile debugger in
which there would be buttons: breakpoint, continue, step, next, inspect, and
quit. The debugger window is also going to show a scrolling box in which it
shows all the contents of the file.

When the user presses the inspect button, it would open another window:
values window. This window would display the current values of the variables.
There would be two buttons: one that hides and one that would update the values window.
There are also four radio buttons in which that would allow the user to see the different
sorting options. The MergeSort function is implemented here.

To compile and run:
qmake
make
./debugger(executable)
